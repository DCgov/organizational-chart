# organizational-chart

An ongoing effort to create a parsable organizational chart of the District's agencies.

`chart.yml` is derived from the [organizational chart released by the Mayor's office](https://github.com/DCgov/organizational-chart/tree/master/files/mayor.dc.gov). It is organized into collections:

* Charter independent agencies
* Executive branch agencies
* Independent agencies
* Judicial branch agencies
* Legislative branch agencies
* Regional bodies

Each entity within those collections has the following information: name, abbreviated name, budget code (when one exists), homepage, the parent entity to which it reports, and any social media pages.

The individual agency organizational charts in the [files folder](https://github.com/DCgov/organizational-chart/tree/master/files) were taken from agency web pages. They are the most current available publicly on the web, though they may not reflect their latest structure.
